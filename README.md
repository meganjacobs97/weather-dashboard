# Weather Dashboard 

## Current and future weather data retrieved using server-side APIs. Features responsive design and dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

This application allows the user to search for a city via form inputs. The search returns weather data including temperature, weather conditions, UV Index, wind speed, humidity, and a five-day forecast. The user's search history is saved using localStorage and the user is presented with their most recent search result upon opening the application. 

I utilized three different APIs and AJAX calls, as familiarizing myself with these was my primary motivation for building this application. I also use Bootstrap for mobile responsiveness. Future development plans would include sprucing up the styling as well as maintaining the most recent searches buttons in their proper order. 

## Installation

To use this application, follow the link on the repository page; otherwise, you can [click here](https://meganjacobs97.github.io/weather-dashboard/).

To modify the code to suit your purposes, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Usage 

To use this application, simply enter the name of a city in the search bar to the left of the page. Your recent searches will be displayed below the search bar; to search a previous search again, simply click on the corresponding button. After searching, the current weather and five-day forecast will be displayed for that city.
